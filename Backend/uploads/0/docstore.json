These signals are widely used in clinical trials for the \ndiagnosis  of  neurological  and  neuromuscular  problems [1]. Because  of  the  complexity  of  EMG  signals many \ntimes even experienced researchers are fail to provide enough information about these signals.  EMG signals in-\nvolve a great deal of information about the nervous system with anatomical and psychological properties of mus-\ncles. It is a record of electrical potentials generated by muscles cell [4]. The changes in the voltage difference be-\ntween electrodes are sensed and amplified before it is transmitted to a computer program to display the tracing of \nthe voltage potential recordings [2].","metadata":{"source":"uploads\\8d85b29db40cd068d565912df5fd8cc8","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Dr.millie","Creator":"Microsoft® Office Word 2007","Producer":"Microsoft® Office Word 2007","CreationDate":"D:20170219115954+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20170219115954+05'30'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":7},"loc":{"pageNumber":1,"lines":{"from":38,"to":47}}}}],["2829d0b8-637a-4d44-90ff-fc3b93362054",{"pageContent":"There are numerous neuromuscular disorders that influence the spinal cord, nerves or muscles.
